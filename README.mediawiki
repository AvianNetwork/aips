People wishing to submit AIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the Avian community. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving AIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community.

Having a AIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Avian community which includes developers, miners, economic majority, and nodes.
